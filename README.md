# Video Individual Counting for Moving Drones (ICCV 2025)
## Introduction
This is the official PyTorch implementation of paper: [Video Individual Counting for Moving Drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10701), which introduce a video-level individual counting dataset captured by fast-moving drones in various crowded scenes and propose a shared density map-guided VIC method
that bypasses the challenging localization step and instead adopts a more learnable manner by first learning shared pedestrian density maps between consecutive frames.
